        <p class="exp">My journey to become a web developer started off accidently and unknowingly.<br/>I had been to a company for internship , my Dad had recommended me there.I am from an electronics background but have some interest about these Computer Science topics.<br><br>During my first visit to the company ,I was assigned a task cum challenge.I had to learn PHP in a week. Now I know it's impossible and a crazy challenge but at that time I din't know anything about.My intension was like it's a 3-lettered programming language so I can learn in a week.<br>On that day since I was very tired because of travelling and all, you know about Bnagalore's traffic na didn't do anything.<br>  </p>
<p>
    Day-1:<br>
    
 &emsp;   Started in full josh in the morning.Started off with PHP,the 3-lettered programming language according to me.......<br>&thinsp;Didn't understand or follow anyhting till the afternoon.It was like greek and latin so winded up for that day....Plans to start off fresh the next day, that day I enjoyed the rest of the day.
